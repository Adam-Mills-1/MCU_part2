# MCU_part2

Part 2 of our analysis of mcu box office performance.

Here we use R to produce visualisations, perform statistical analysis and produce some regression models to better understand the critical and financial success of this series. ggplot2 was used to construct numerous visualisations such as bar charts, line graphs and animations to explore the data made available in part 1.
